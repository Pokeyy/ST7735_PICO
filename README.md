# Purpose
## The purpose of this project was to help me improve at coding in C, and possibly a little C++ by learning how to develop a driver with minimal libraries for the ST7735 TFT LCD Screen

# Overview
## This project is a driver to support the ST7735 on the Pi Pico RP2040/RP2350 Platform. Please refer to the Getting Started/Setup section with additional information if attempting to use this repository for yourself.

# Examples

# Resources
## The repositories below helped me a lot when trying to understand better code practices, what to look for when creating my own driver, and are much better than what I have tried to produce.

# Setup: 
## This utilizes Pi Pico SDK Extension on VSCode
