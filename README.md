## Purpose
- The purpose of this project was to help myself improve at coding in C/C++ by learning how to develop a driver with a minimal amount of libraries used for the ST7735 TFT LCD Screen.
- I aimed to focus on improving my programming skills as a whole, understand the SPI Protcol better, and learn better practices for coding.
- The project for this driver will hopefully help build a solid foundation I can apply to more projects and expand upon knowing the ins-and-outs of the driver.

## Overview
This project is a driver to support the ST7735 on the Pi Pico RP2040/RP2350 Platform. Please refer to the Getting Started/Setup section with additional information if attempting to use this repository for yourself.

## Examples

## Resources
The repositories below helped me a lot when trying to understand better code practices, what to look for when creating my own driver, and are much better than what I have tried to produce. I have referenced them multiple times, and don't claim any of their work as my own. I have utilized the code in these repositories to save time if I had felt the code was not needed to be replicated on my own. (i.e. creating my own font)
